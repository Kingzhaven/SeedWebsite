## Project 1


*On a web browser a user is able to click on the "Logo" or "Home" Buttons to be on the main page. From there, the user is able to contact the site owner via the Contact form located next to the "Home Button"
Finally there is a static Cart page to reflect a transaction (buy now, or add to cart).*

*Display, Contact, and Checkout Website*

*.html ; .css ; Bootstrap ; Javascript used*


<sub> In the future I would like to improve on the checkout page and make it more interactive. Also, I would like the carosel items to be able to be added to the cart. Last, a request for other types of product page would be a good addition. </sub>
